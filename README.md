We all subscribe to a lot of YouTube channels, but over time, they can fill up your feed and mess with the recommendation algorithm. That's why we (you, me, and the amazing GPT-3.5) created this handy tool!

With just one click, you can unsubscribe from all your channels and start fresh with a clean slate. 

Big Credit for GPT4o❤️
